NASA Space Apps 2023 project. In this project we will be developing a solution to use "raw" data from DSCOVR—faults and all—to predict geomagnetic storms on Earth.

## Some background

Geomagnetic storms are a serious threat to modern technologies, particularly GPS satellite systems and electrical power grids. These storms are caused by strong gusts of wind or storms from the Sun, which deform Earth's magnetic field and shower particles into Earth's magnetic poles.

DSCOVR is a space weather station that orbits about a million miles from Earth. It measures the plasma that may cause geomagnetic storms hours before it reaches Earth, providing an early warning of what's coming our way. NOAA uses these measurements to forecast when a geomagnetic storm will occur and how strong it will be. Currently, DSCOVR is nearing the end of its mission, and its solar wind instrument is losing sensitivity, which makes it more important than ever to develop new space weather forecasting tools.
